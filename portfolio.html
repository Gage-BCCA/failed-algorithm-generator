        I absolutely love programming.The idea that we can manipulate these
        awesome, digital systems into doing tasks and playing games really
        excites me.

      <p>
        My favorite languages (so far) are Python, Rust, and Javascript. I much
        prefer the backend side of things, but doing some UI on my personal
        projects isn't too bad.

        I've been in IT for most of my working life, and have fallen in love
        with well put-together systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        A big career goal of mine is to be in a position where I can design,
        implement, and maintain a large, complex system that offers lots of
        opportunities for efficiency and security.

        I remember creating my prime number generator. It took an upper bound
        and returned a list of prime integers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I learned about the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which made my little
        generator about a million times faster. Afterwards, I went from an
        interpreted language to a compiled one. We were going fast. I was hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since then, I love refactoring my programs and making them
        <em>faster</em> by finding more efficient algorithms and attacking bottlenecks.

      <h2>Python</h2>

        Python is one of my favorite languages. It's the one I started with,

      <h2>Rust</h2>

        Webapps are fun to make! I mainly focus on the backend side of things,
        but I like to design a nice website every now and again.

            I have created some custom deployment tools to make my headaches go
            away, including a recursive file copier so that I can (almost)
            instantly copy my static site files to the other local repo for
            commiting and pushing.

            I wanted to learn the web stack and vanilla Javascript, so I have
            not used any libraries in creation of this site! Well... that's not
            totally true: I used the Prism code highlighting Javascript library
            because it's awesome. But outside of that, it's totally vanilla and
            handwritten.
