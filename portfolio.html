      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>
        Python is one of my favorite languages. It's the one I started with,
        too!

    <div class="skill-card">
      <h2>Rust</h2>
      <p>
        Rust is fast and safe, two of my favorite things. I try to write most of
        my personal projects in Rust now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-card">
      <h2>HTML/CSS/Javascript</h2>
      <p>
        Webapps are fun to make! I mainly focus on the backend side of things,
        but I like to design a nice website every now and again.

        I digest a lot of logs, investigate potential malware, and send a lot of

        I created this website with 11ty, a static site generator. It helps me
        keep track of all my blog posts and tags.

            Custom Deployment Tools Written in Rust

          <p>
            I have created some custom deployment tools to make my headaches go
            away, including a recursive file copier so that I can (almost)
            instantly copy my static site files to the other local repo for
            commiting and pushing.

          <p>
            I wanted to learn the web stack and vanilla Javascript, so I have
            not used any libraries in creation of this site! Well... that's not
            totally true: I used the Prism code highlighting Javascript library
            because it's awesome. But outside of that, it's totally vanilla and
            handwritten.

            A simple web interface that allows the password protection of links.
            Provide a link and password, get a shortened version back, and

            In an effort to learn industry standards, all passwords are hashed
            and salted when stored in the database. It's pretty cool!

    I'll write about here, on this site.
