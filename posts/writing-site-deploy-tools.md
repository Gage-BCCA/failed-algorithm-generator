title: "Toolcrafting: Writing My Own Site Deployment Tools In Rust"
tags: rust
blurb: 
 I wanted to host my 11ty-generated site on Github pages without screwing around with
 Github Actions. My solution was two separate repos, with one controlling the 11ty
 project and the other hosting the static sites for Github Pages. As you can imagine,
 this had lead to some headaches. I addressed this using my new ADHD obsession, Rust.
